The Story So Far

Wake, brave developer...{{0:4}}You find yourself on an unexplored planet, one that's
name has since been lost to time...{{0:4}}Having volunteered for the Development Program, you've
selflessly left your birthworld behind, traveled light-years
across space and time, and, at last, arrived here...{{0:4}}However, the journey was long and harsh, robbing you
of the fickle form that you once called your body.

Excellent. And thus, your body, now better suited for your
adventure, has been remade... Though compared to your
old form, this one may take some getting used to.{{0:4}}I hope you don't mind—along with ethereal strength, I
took the liberty of adding a {{0:3 arg="0x0000"}}tail{{0:3 arg="0xFFFF"}}. It should prove useful
through your many journeys in planetary development.{{0:4}}With your new form and your adventurer's heart, let's
begin the Basic Training Program.
May fortune favor you, brave developer.
